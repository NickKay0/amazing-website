This is my personal website that contains my personal projects, academic and professional experience, general information about me and aswell my cv and contact info.

It's built from the ground up using pure HTML/CSS/Javascript, and it's compatible for desktop and mobile alike. I strive for it to have a modern, slick look and user friendly UI Design.
It will act an extension platform to push my projects and contents i find noteworthy, aside from my github.

Enjoy :3
